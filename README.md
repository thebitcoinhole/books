## Collaboration

Inside the `items` directory, there is a JSON file for each book, with all the data about it. To collaborate (adding missing data, fixing wrong data or adding a new book), just fork the repository and send a pull request with the changes.

Before sending the pull request, please run the following commands to format the JSON:

```
cd scripts/
node json-format.js
```

## JSON format

The following is a sample of the JSON format:

```json
{
    "id": "book-id",
    "name": "Book Name",
    "purchasable": true,
    "category-name": {
      "feature-name-1": {
        "value": "YES", 
        "flag": "positive",
        "supported": true,
        "texts": [
          "Optional contextual text describing the feature"
        ],
        "links": [
          {
            "title": "Optional contextual link referencing official documentation",
            "url": "url"

        "value": "NO",
        "flag": "negative",
        "supported": false
