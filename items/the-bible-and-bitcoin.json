  "description": "Our current monetary system is broken. Inflation is rampant, our savings are being devalued, and it seems there is no hope for a solution. Fiat money is robbing us and our neighbors of our most valuable commodity - time. As Christians, we are called to love our neighbors, but how can we do that when the money we use is contributing to a system that is stealing from them? It may seem unconventional, but Bitcoin offers a solution to this problem. The Bible calls for a just and equal monetary system, free of fraud and deception - and Bitcoin fits the bill.\nJoin Pastor Alin Patularu as he delves into the intersection of biblical and monetary history, embarking on a journey that ultimately leads to the unlikely destination of Bitcoin, the native currency of the internet."
