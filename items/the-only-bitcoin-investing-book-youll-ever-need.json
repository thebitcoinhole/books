  "description": "If you feel like you’ve “missed the boat” on Bitcoin. Think again…\nBecause while Bitcoin continues to hit all-time highs, this book will show you it’s not too late to invest in “Digital Gold”\n\nWhat was once a fringe currency only used by a dark corner of the web… is now the fastest growing financial asset on Earth.\nAnd this is just the beginning…\nYou see, we are still in just the 2nd inning of Bitcoin as a financial entity.\nSo while no financial vehicle is making people rich as quickly as Bitcoin…\nLess than 10% of Americans and 2% of the worldwide population owns it.\nBut now, the major players are taking an interest.\nLike Billionaire Hedge Fund owner Paul Tudor Jones, Internet pioneer Tim Draper, who was an early investor in companies like Hotmail, Tesla and Robinhood, and CEO of Social Capital, Chamath Palihapitiya, who predicts Bitcoin will be worth $1 million within the next 15 years.\nSo even if you’ve been unconvinced thus far, this book will give you the straight facts on Bitcoin as a financial asset… without any of the hype or noise.\nHere is just a fraction of what you will discover:\n- The surprisingly small amount of Bitcoin you need to join the top 1% of Bitcoin owners worldwide\n- How a complete technophobe can buy Bitcoin in less than 5 minutes\n- 5 Billionaires who believe Bitcoin has a part to play in the world economy\n- Is Bitcoin a legitimate currency?\n- A simple way to automate your Bitcoin purchases so you can take advantage of dollar cost averaging\n- The exact percentage of Bitcoin transactions that are used for illegal activities. Anti-Bitcoiners get this wrong all the time\n- Why you should never use Robinhood to buy Bitcoin\n- The downside of purchasing Bitcoin funds like GBTC\n- How much of your portfolio should you dedicate to Bitcoin? Our “one size fits all” solution\nThis is not a 600-page theoretical book which you need a math degree to understand. Written in plain English and free from repetitive technical jargon. Every single piece of financial and technical terminology is clearly defined inside.\nYou’ll find easy-to-follow advice on how to buy and store Bitcoin yourself… without having to pay expensive fees to middlemen.\nFor everyone who feels frustrated after watching Bitcoin soar in price… this is your chance to get in while the going is good.\nAnd not feel like you missed the boat…\nSo even if you’ve never read a single finance or investing book in your life, you will immediately understand how to become a successful long-term investor."
