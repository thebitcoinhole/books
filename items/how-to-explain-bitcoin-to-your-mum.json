  "description": "It’s hard enough to explain what Bitcoin is to someone who has never heard of it, but where do you even start for someone who doesn’t use the internet? Or have a mobile phone? Like, for example, my mum.\n\n\nThis book is the answer. Written with the absolute beginner in mind and using non-technical analogies, it will take you through everything from understanding what it is, how it works, who runs it and what could happen next as use of this fascinating – and divisive - alternative to money spreads throughout the world.\n\nSo, whether you’re a total novice and want to learn all the essential facts, a Bitcoin guru who wants to find simple ways to explain it to other people or just curious about the whole thing, this book is for you."
